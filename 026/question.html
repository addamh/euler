<p>
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal 
representation of the unit fractions with denominators 
2 to 10 are given:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2}&amp;=0.5 \\\\
\frac{1}{3}&amp;=0.\overline{3} \\\\
\frac{1}{4}&amp;=0.25 \\\\
\frac{1}{5}&amp;=0.2 \\\\
\frac{1}{6}&amp;=0.1\overline{6} \\\\
\frac{1}{7}&amp;=0.\overline{142857} \\\\
\frac{1}{8}&amp;=0.125 \\\\
\frac{1}{9}&amp;=0.\overline{1} \\\\
\frac{1}{10}&amp;=0.1
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
Where \(0.1\overline{6}\) means \(0.1666\dots\), and has a 1-digit recurring 
cycle. It can be seen that \(\frac{1}{7}\) has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
</p>

<p>
Find the value of \(d &lt; 1000\) for which \(\frac{1}{d}\) contains the longest 
recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
