The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding 
the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be
\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\). The first ten terms would be:
</p>

\[1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...\]

<p>
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
</p>

<pre><code>1:  1
3:  1,3
6:  1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
</code></pre>

<p>
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over
five divisors. What is the value of the first triangle number
to have over five hundred divisors?
